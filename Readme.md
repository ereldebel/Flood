An abstract static wave-based first-person shooter inspired by the arcade games: _Duck Hunt_ and _Space Invaders_.

Protect your islands!
Stop the enemies from reaching the water.


Move the mouse left and right to rotate the camera. Aim the gun and use the left mouse button to shoot.

The game was created by Orian Kidron, Nadav Baruch, Gilad Binshtok and I (with the former 2 as designers and the latter 2 as developers) as our 1st game jam, over a 2 week period in the _Gaming Lab_ course as part of the _Bezalel_ Game Development and Design Minor of my Computer Science B.Sc. in _The Hebrew University_, Jerusalem, Israel.
