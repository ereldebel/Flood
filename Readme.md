# Flood

An abstract static wave-based first-person shooter.

The game was created by Orian Kidron, Nadav Baruch, Gilad Binshtok and myself (with the former 2 as designers and the latter 2 as developers) as our first game jam, over a 2 week period in the _Gaming Lab_ course as part of the _Bezalel_ Game Development and Design Minor of my Computer Science B.Sc. in _The Hebrew University_, Jerusalem, Israel.

This repository contains the game's source code.

The game can be downloaded for free at: https://oriank.itch.io/flood
